19,"Create or update a website that compiles ALL information/resources regarding sustainability initiatives on campus, so students and faculty have a centralized point of reference to stay in touch and be aware of MIT's role in sustainability. This would include regularly updated lists of majors, minors,, clubs, research projects, classes, etc. related to sustainability. It may alo act as a platform to announce upcoming events and talks to connect students with their sustainability interests. This could potentially be implemented as a UROP to incentivizr engagement for whoever develops it.",18,0,"Current sustainability groups and online resources are decentralized and out of date, resulting in a lack of awareness about on-campus activities. This creates a barrier of entry into the sutainability effort for not only students, but also faculty who require interest and manpower for sutstainability research",0,100.0,✅
11,"Revamp the Office of Sustainability so that they have better connections and communication with student led groups. Doing so would facilitate communication between student groups better making sustainability topic at MIT more present under the umbreall of MITOS. Furthermore, increase MITOS presence possibly through creating/promoting student evetns, student initiatives etc",17,0,"As the MIT administration's headquarters for sustainability, it would make sense for it to also be the centralized hub of information for students interested in exploring. From MITOS, students should be able to hear about the different groups and opportunities on campus.",1,94.44444444444444,✅
13,"MIT should implement and advertise GTL and MISTI programs centered around sustainability and partner with more sustainable companies for jobs, internships, or research opportunities, allowing students to explore different approaches and technologies globally.",17,1,MISTI programs are valuable as they allow students to discover how problems related to climate change might be explored differently in other countries or settings. GTL are needed in order to educate more people about new technologies and solutions around sustainability.,0,94.44444444444444,✅
23,Increase transparency on the allocation of MIT's invenstment and endowment from fossil fuel companies (how much of mit is actually funded by fossil fuels and how does. it comapre to the totality of MIT's funding) (like a public report analyzing the statistics and data) (and avoid breaching contract terms affiliated with transparency),16,1,"Currently, MIT's investment in fossil fuel companies is contradictory to its sustainability goals, and increasee. transparency on the specific impact of and MIT's reliance on this funding is necessary to hold MIT accountable to its commitment to sustainability/to acknowledge what current actions should take place",1,88.88888888888889,✅
4,"MIT should implement an educational program similar to GTL for the purpose of educating youth about low-cost sustainable practices and climate science. The program should be no-cost for participants, and prioritize those from low-income communities or those where climate science is not included in public school district curriculum. When possible, MIT student educators should be matched to programs in communities similar to their own background, to improve communicability and understanding of local climate challenges.",16,2,"Education is commonly acknowledged as one of the most important and viable ways to spread sustainability and its practices. Individuals not exposed to climate science in primary or secondary school may never receive that information in an educational setting, decreasing the chance of their adoption of sustainable practices. Knowledge is most powerful when shared.",0,88.88888888888889,✅
5,"Make MIT's public transportation more usable and approachable for students, such as improving the accuracy of shuttles' live locations, adding more shuttles to every route, and extending the Boston route further.",16,1,The current shuttle service is so inefficient that students would choose to Uber to places nearby instead of waiting for shuttles to arrive. A better system would encourage more students to take advantage of public transporation and reduce carbon emission.,1,88.88888888888889,✅
6,"MIT should expand its collaboration with Eversource to reduce powergrid reliance on fossil fuels. This could mean by funding, planning and infrastructure upgrades, and/or project development. In order to electrify buildings and decarbonize, MIT Campus Services & Campus Planning is already working with Eversource to move to a greener grid, but this plan needs to be accelerated and placed at the forefront of efforts. However, MIT must also ensure equity with this process, whether through modeling, subsidies, or other means.",16,1,"While MIT doesn’t need to rely completely on Eversource’s power grid, most of Massachusetts does. It’s important that MIT’s campus not become a bubble for sustainability. The institution should do what it can to allow renewable energy to source its surrounding area as well. Renewable energy is also much cheaper than fossil fuels in the long-term (price per kwh is less), so residents will see cheaper electricity bills in the future.",1,88.88888888888889,✅
18,Increased messaging from MIT Office of Sustainability on how to get involved on campus. This should include email messages and/or a newsletter. This can also include events at dorms or advertising through house gov meetings. Food can be used to drive attendance.,16,1,Raises awareness of sustainability opportunities on campus,1,88.88888888888889,✅
20,"Increase awareness of sustainability midway. Include student groups, researchers/UROP opportunities, and companies. Advertise through dormspam and encourage professors to advertise to classes.",16,0,"A sustainability fiar would give students a chance to network and get involved in student groups, research and activism, and learn about opportunities workin gin renewable energy and climate change mitigation",2,88.88888888888889,✅
16,"Centralize al information (education, research, operations) (e.g. courseroads, UROPs, current projects, initiatives) under the MIT Offcie of sustainability, connecting offices and departments. MITOS serves as central point of contact and information distributor",15,1,there is too much bureaucracy and decentralization for effective information distribution; students have limited avenues of finding all opportunities to become involced with MIT sustainability initiatives,2,83.33333333333334,✅
15,"We need greater support for MITOS's food waste fighters program to increase accessibility to composting around campus via adding compost bins, especially in/around dorms. This also includes putting informational posters on how to recycle/compost at every waste disposal location and common space (like elevators and lounges) to increase waste management education.",15,2,"Food waste occurs everywhere in campus, not just in dining halls, and there are little to no checks in place to reduce waste outside formal eating spaces",1,83.33333333333334,✅
9,"Within the UROP program, highlight research and internship opportunities for sustainable efforts. This could mean partnering with other MIT initiatives or outside organizations that could use student help. Increase visibility of ongoing efforts in which students can contribute their skills and apply what they're majoring in with real-life results to improve the environment.",15,0,"Having a formal, institutionalized proogram would give students a central place to look for resources and ways to actually take action. It could also spark personal investment in sustainability, especially as students learn more through their projects. The hope is that students would be motivated to work on such projects even if it's not necessarily beacuse of the ""sustainable"" benefits but at least to gain real-world experience. If they end up entering the field, great! Either way, this program would also get more people working on sustainability efforts.",3,83.33333333333334,✅
27,"Sustainability GIR (ideally), if GIR is unfeasible, REST class that would fill requirement for all majors. Features: 1) curriculum focused on sustainability/social impact 2) project-based, so students can tailor activity to their major 3) end of term showcase with industry employers/investors (similar to 2.009) to incentivize students with career prospects",15,1,"MIT students seem most motivated by career prospects/money, and least motivated by stringent requirements — therefore idea behind this class is to provide a hands on way to make clear the career paths that exist in sustainability/social impact, with direct tangible outcomes like potential employment, and competition aspect to encourage engagement — 2.009 style comp would also serve as good publicity for MIT/participating employers' commitment to their 2026/2050 goals",2,83.33333333333334,✅
22,Add a filter to the course catalog for classes on climate and sustainability,15,1,Allows students to see course offerings across the many schools and departments on one page,2,83.33333333333334,✅
7,"In general, work towards commissioning more large-scale renewable energy projects (ex. Solar farms, offshore wind power, nuclear plants, etc.) similar to the solar farm PPA (Power Purchase Agreement). MIT should continue to collaborate with various organizations to create these PPAs in areas that will create jobs and have the most impact on the powergrid (""dirty grid"" areas).",15,2,"As Joe Higgins said, one of the best things MIT can use its resources to do on a nation-wide scale is to start large renewable energy projects to put more renewable energy into the nation’s power grid. This provides the biggest impact per investment dollar since it’s hard to produce renewable energy on campus. The creation of large renewable energy hubs can completely change the economic scene of the area the project is in as well, giving it clean energy and potential jobs.",1,83.33333333333334,✅
2,"Install motion sensor lights in MIT buildings, especially in academic buildings and dorm hallways. For example, a policy can be implemented to ensure lights only turn on when people pass by from 11pm to 7am.",15,1,Full illumination is not needed at times when few people visit the hallways regularly. Implementing this change will reduce MIT's electricity costs and save energy.,2,83.33333333333334,✅
3,"Reduce food waste through increased composting around campus:
1) Have compost bins in residence hall kitchens and kitchens around campus in every building
2) Increase signage and have posters near and around compost bins showing people what can be composted and why it is important",14,1,"These policies have minimal disruption, but have the potential to greatly decrease food waste if done correctly. Increasing compost bins would help in better disposal of food waste, and updated signage can help students figure out appropriate disposal.",3,77.77777777777779,❌
26,"Create more opportunities for UROPs in the sustainability field, specifically geared towards freshman and sophomore students",14,2,"Many first year students want UROPs, but don't know where to start especially in the fall. Expanding opportunities for first year students in sustainability focused UROPs will help them learn more about sustainability at MIT and encourage them to continue learning about the field. This also has the added benefit of expanding sustainability research at MIT as a whole.",2,77.77777777777779,❌
12,"Set up and host recurring (1-2 times a semester?) forums for the MIT community to discuss current sustainability efforts on campus. Specifically, there should be communication across student groups (ex. UA sustain, MITEC, MITEI, SSC....) as well as administrative offices. The goal would be to keep groups informed and possibly share resources/feedback, with the common goal of improving campus sustainability.",13,4,"There are as many separate groups & efforts across MIT that want to help MIT's sustainability efforts, however, they are mostly disconnected and uninformed about what other groups might be targeting and working on.",1,72.22222222222221,❌
8,"Create a public-facing student working group for decarbonization that is continuously informed about MIT's decarbonization process, easy to join for the general student body, and has access to all touchpoint meetings pertaining to decarbonization (including meetings with the external consultant). This student group will also assist with communicating decarbonization plans and getting input from the larger student body.",13,2,"Highlighted ease of access for the entire student body. Since MIT Is currently in financing stage with external consultant, it is important students understand the steps and rationale behind the process in order to build a foundation for effective communication around decarbonization. We can add value to the decarbonization process by bringing this forward to the general student body. Continuously being informed is key to ensure that as students graduate, students continue to have avenues to be part of the decarbonization effort, in order to teach systems thinking and foster interest in sustainability.",3,72.22222222222221,❌
1,"An Ethics and Sustainability HASS class should be implemented as a required CI-H for Course 6-4: Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making. This class would replace one preexisting General Institute HASS CI-H requirements for 6-4 majors, and be offered, with priority for 6-4 students, to all students. Additionally, the course should be evaluated after two semesters for efficacy, and if found sufficient, be used as a blueprint for Ethics and Sustainability courses in other disciplines.",12,2,"Artificial Intelligence and LLM programs have thus far been dependent upon large energy and water reserves to function. As their development continues, it is important for developers to consider the ramifications of such programs upon sustainability and natural resources, and whether the benefits of its implementation outweigh the potential for environmental harm.",4,66.66666666666666,❌
25,The climate steering committee should devote resources towards helping other universities make power purchase agreements. Those involved in previous purchases should advise others on the process.,12,2,"MIT has been successful at forming a coalition with other universities and local instituions to make power purchase agreements. According to our expert panel, investing in the construction of renewables is a relatively low cost, high impact way to contribute to solving the climate crisis. These power purchase agreements are difficult to understand, so MIT should use its knowledge to help others.",4,66.66666666666666,❌
14,"Incorporate a focus on sustainability, climate, and energy in an Ethics for Engineers course. This could be done by altering the existing Ethics by Engineers class by adding a “sustainability” component, or by creating a new class dedicated to the topic.",12,2,educating engineers on how their work and research is related to sustainability and about the companies that support sustainable practices and educating the impacts of oil and gas companies,4,66.66666666666666,❌
21,"Increased funding for sustainability clubs, to allow them to host more events and boost involvement.",11,5,"This would make more students aware of sutainability clubs, and improve membership. Involvement in these clubs will make students more likely to pursue sustainability related research and careers",2,61.111111111111114,❌
0,Implement a social impact GIR as outlined by Megan Lim's Systems/World Awareness Integration white paper.,10,7,"Will require students to consider how their career can tie into social impact, which includes sustainability and climate action. Other areas can tie into it too, and a wider scope on the principle of social responsibility itself is necessary for cultivating a culture surrounding it on campus.",1,55.55555555555556,❌
24,Divest the endowment from fossil fuels within the next 5 years,10,4,"MIT will set an example through action rather than just words and inspire other institutions to follow. Additionally, since fossil fuels make up only a small portion of the endowment, this could be done at minimal cost especially when spread over a 5 year timeframe",4,55.55555555555556,❌
17,"Incorporate a sustainability requirement for all majors, similar to a GIR. This requirement could be filled by any one class from a catalog of sustainability classes with different focuses",9,7,It's important that sustainability is practiced across all fields. A required class would teach students how stainability plays into their courses and bring sustainability further into the collective conscious,2,50.0,❌
10,"Since every major at MIT can involve some aspect of sustainability, I propose we implement the topic of sustainability and how it relates to that specific class subject within the curriculum for each major's course requirement classes. This would allow students to be exposed to how sustainability relates to their respective field in a digestible, unimposing manner throughout their four years. For instance, an artificial intelligence course discusses the climate impact of AI.",9,6,This would ensure that throughout a student's four years they'll be cognizant of how their major aligns with sustainability.,3,50.0,❌
28,"Waive meal plan requirements for all students in all dorms, and make unused food for the day available to students who need it at a reduced price.",4,8,"It gives students the freedom of choice between on-campus dining and CFY, which can reduce the amountn of students using the dining hall. This reduces food waste and encourages more students to make the sustainable switch to CFY.",6,22.22222222222222,❌
