29,Frame climate change as a common issue and enhance education and information dissemination about it.,Communication & Transparency,agent_1,"...that definitely diverse people's attention. Like kind of framing back into what has of what F was saying about climate change being considered like an elitist problem. Like, I, I think even back home because I really didn't learn a lot about climate change when I was in high school as well. That was also kind of the way that I thought about it too unfortunately. Just because I feel like there are a lot of issues, you know, that we kind of see on the day to day basis. You know, things like homelessness or things like you know, of domestic violence resources or the lack of resources for people who are underserved in our communities. Like those are real, real things that we can see unfold in front of us. Whereas climate change is kind of a more nuanced topic. So in terms of framing that from and leaders problem into just a common issue and a very big issue that all of us should take action to be fixing. Like, should also be a really big part of whether it be like through education, through curriculum or just through general information that passes out to, you know, our common Joe.

38,Discuss the panelists' expertise to inform sustainability questions.,Communication & Transparency,agent_0,"Do we want to just go in a circle and everybody can read one of these aloud? Would it be more helpful if we read them all, like, just continuously? Or do you want to read and then have a discussion?"
39,Focus on specific sustainability initiatives rather than general discussions.,Communication & Transparency,agent_2,Might be more useful though we ask about like a specific sustainability initiative than just like sustainability initiatives in general.

66,Increase access to information about sustainability initiatives to raise awareness and engagement.,Communication & Transparency,agent_3,"we should, I don't know, give more access to this information or kind of, like, advertise it or, like, tell a lot more people or, like, yeah, just, like, in general, like, more people should know, because I feel like a lot more people are passionate about it"
67,Create a well-defined communication path to inform students about sustainability opportunities.,Communication & Transparency,agent_4,"there's not really a good way to, like, currently get that information out to students. Like, people just don't know about the opportunities that exist for a lot of those things because there's not, like, a well defined path for it."
68,Improve communication strategies to engage community members early in sustainability projects.,Communication & Transparency,agent_1,I was wondering how you could change the way information is passed from top to bottom to prevent and sort of get those talks and get those people on board early on so that we can avoid those bottlenecks later on during the implementation process.
69,MIT should clarify the progress and timelines of sustainability initiatives.,Communication & Transparency,agent_3,"I kind of want to know more about, like, where in the process those hurt at because he kind of just said, like, oh, yeah, these are the things that were gonna happen in a couple years."

72,MIT should prioritize deeper discussions on sustainability topics.,Communication & Transparency,agent_1,I felt like some of their answers were a bit too top level and not deep enough.
73,MIT should provide more detailed information on specific technologies being researched and their timelines.,Communication & Transparency,agent_2,"I do wish they went, like, a little bit deeper into, like, what specific technologies we're researching and, like, how far down the road those are going to be."
74,Communicate the need for sustainability in a way that highlights profitability to incentivize action.,Communication & Transparency,agent_3,"And essentially, I think that when they were talking about it, it always comes down to how we communicate the need for sustainability and how we can shape it into something profitable so that people are actually incentivized to push it forward."

And this feels like one of those issues where it's like, I don't think the issue is getting more people into the field because maybe we've reached the bottleneck and maybe this is as many people as would be to care about climate change. So it's about motivating the rest of the world who like, don't really see sustainability as a very integral part of their lives to think of it as their civic responsibility to do something, to contribute in whichever way possible."
95,MIT should aim to be a model for sustainability to inspire other universities.,Community Engagement & Partnerships,agent_5,"I feel like at least trying to be that model, but would probably help other universities try to achieve that. I don't know. I think optimism is a good thing to have."
96,MIT should achieve its own sustainability goals to build trust and encourage others to adopt similar measures.,Community Engagement & Partnerships,agent_0,"I think it also develops trust from others as like, if we are the one who wants to like, post solutions to help solve worlds sustainably, we should already be sustainable, to gain trust from people, to like adopt our measures and keep implementing that to the world if we are like, if we reach our goal, the sustainability goal, like ourselves."

110,Explore the impact of Citizen Assemblies on local sustainability changes.,Community Engagement & Partnerships,agent_2,"I guess we can talk about like Citizen Assembly. I had like one question about them. Like, I think the articles like did like go well into.

114,Encourage local community members to come together to share opinions and learn from each other to enhance sustainability efforts.,Community Engagement & Partnerships,agent_1,"Essentially, I would argue that just from the video we just watched in terms of the feedback that was received by people who were actually delegated and participated. Like if anything, if these local people who's had opinions, had their own values about this issue could actually come together and learn more from each other, I think that's a win like that in itself."
115,Ensure commitment from stakeholders to listen to community input before implementing sustainability initiatives.,Community Engagement & Partnerships,agent_3,"If you saw the slide with all the Benny groups that came to make it together, that's why it was effective is because before the assembly you had to have people commit to listening to you before the assembly."

117,Improve attendance and participation in sustainability club meetings.,Community Engagement & Partnerships,agent_1,"but then they'll have, like, one meeting a month where all the clubs are supposed to come together, but then people don't show up to represent their club, so it's like they kind of just fall off the face."

And just thinking about it when you connect, consider other countries. I think I'm thinking specifically of Iran because I know that their like oil supply is nationally owned. So obviously that's a big part of how they're able. And Iran has its own problems, but they are able to fund education and like subsidize a lot of things through having nationally owned oil supplies. It's almost thinking about, it's almost just as Important for Iranians to buy into switching from fossil fuels or have backup solutions. Because if you view like moving from fossil fuels as inevitable, then they need to obviously worry about how their government is going to continue to function to the level that it is, knowing that fossil fuels probably will be or definitely will be phased out."
